Create a small web application (backend) in expressjs for submitting user information (username, password, full name, gender, date of birth, country) and then store them in the database. the above process registers the user, additionally search the user by username or email, then retrieve their full info after login to the system. use expressjs, mongodb. I should be able to use the apis in postman. after completing the project upload it to your github repo, and give a full video walkthrough of how it works (source codes, output, postman result, database). use JWT token to handle the auth. 

3 end points -> user registration, user login, search user, 
techstack to use -> expressjs (nodejs), mongodb, jwt
it's important to structure the source codes, name properly, enforce data validation in server side.
